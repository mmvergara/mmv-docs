This triggers a function call to `delete_post_image` after a delete in the posts table occurs that will delete the image relative to that post
```sql
create trigger on_post_delete
  after delete on public.posts
  for each row execute procedure public.delete_post_image();
```


### 
This trigger function is for when a user is created the handle_new_user function will be invoked and will input userdata in the profiles table.
```sql
create trigger on_auth_user_created
  after insert on auth.users
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();
