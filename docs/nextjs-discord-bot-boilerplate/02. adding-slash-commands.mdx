# Adding Slash Commands

This template makes adding command easier as upon a new command is requested a function will loop through the commands folder to fetch then and to execute a specific command requested. same process is done when registering the commands so you don't have to manually hard-code commands to process them

## 1. Add a new TS File in the Command directory

the commands directory is located in `/commands` (root folder) and add a new TS File there

## 2. Add register and execute

:::danger Important!

- the command title/name should match the command.ts file for ex. for `ping` command you should name the file `ping.ts`
- Don't change register and execute variable names

:::

2 values should be exported in a new slash command which are the register and execute

### register

This is the variable used when we are going to register our commands using the discord api

```js
export const register = new SlashCommandBuilder()
  .setName("ping")
  .setDescription("pong's you back! (bot check)");
```

### execute

This function is executed when a user calls a specific command

```ts
export const execute = async (
  interaction: APIApplicationCommandInteraction
): Promise<APIInteractionResponse> => {
  // Bot Logic Here
  return {
    type: 4,
    data: {
      content: `pong! ${interaction.member?.user.username}`,
    },
  };
};
```

## tutorialhere.ts

```ts
import { SlashCommandBuilder } from "@discordjs/builders";
import { executeCommand } from "@/types";

// to add a command go to ./commands folder and create a new ts file

// the command title/name should match the command.ts file for
//      ex. for tutorialhere command you should name the file tutorialhere.ts

// Don't change register and execute variable names
export const register = new SlashCommandBuilder()
  .setName("tutorialhere")
  .setDescription("description of your command");

export const execute: executeCommand = async (interaction) => {
  // You have access to do interaction object
  // https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object

  // Do your bot logic here
  // You can even connect to a database

  // you should return a APIInteractionResponse
  // https://discord-api-types.dev/api/discord-api-types-v10#APIApplicationCommandInteraction
  return {
    type: 4,
    data: {
      content: `Hello World! ${interaction.member?.user.username}`,
    },
  };
};
```
