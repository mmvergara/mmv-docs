# Introduction

Hello!ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mark Matthew M. Vergara <br/>
This documentation website is for the apps I made that i wanted to make documents for the apps i think deserves or need it. I personally like to look back on my projects, to review design patterns, how much i improved in every project and also documenting them i think is a good way to **express my passion in coding** in general. 

There's a lot more reason why am I doing this but I'm gonna leave it like that for now.
