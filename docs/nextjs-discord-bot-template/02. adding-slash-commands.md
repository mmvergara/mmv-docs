# Adding Slash Commands

This template makes adding command easier as upon a new command is requested a function will loop through the commands folder to fetch then and to execute a specific command requested. same process is done when registering the commands so you don't have to manually hard-code commands to process them

## 1. Add a new TS File in the Command directory

the commands directory is located in`pages/api/discord-bot/commands` and add a new TS File there

## 2. Add register and execute

:::danger Take care

- the command title/name should match the command.ts file for ex. for `ping` command you should name the file `ping.ts`
- Don't change register and execute variable names

:::

2 values should be exported in a new slash command which are the register and execute

### register

This is the variable used when we are going to register our commands using the discord api

```js
export const register = new SlashCommandBuilder().setName("ping").setDescription("pong's you back! (bot check)");
```

### execute

This function is executed when a user calls a specific command

```ts
export const execute = async (interaction: APIApplicationCommandInteraction): Promise<APIInteractionResponse> => {
  return {
    type: 4,
    data: {
      content: `pong! ${interaction.member?.user.username}`,
    },
  };
};
```
